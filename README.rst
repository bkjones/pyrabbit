==================
PyRabbit
==================

pyrabbit is a module to make it easy to interface w/ RabbitMQ's HTTP Management
API.  It's tested against RabbitMQ 2.4.1 and 2.6.1 using Python 2.6-3.4. It has
a pretty solid set of tests, and I use tox to test across Python versions.

PyRabbit is on PyPI, which makes it installable using pip or easy_install.

See the documentation at http://pyrabbit.readthedocs.org

Please send pull requests! Pyrabbit doesn't yet provide 100% coverage of
the exposed RabbitMQ API, so dig in!
